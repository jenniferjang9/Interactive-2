           Narwhals are medium-size marine mammals known for their characteristic tusk that resembles a unicorn's horn. Their reclusive nature and remote Arctic habitat only adds to the mystery of these creatures.
          The name "narwhal" comes from the Norse words "nar" (corpse) and "hval" (whale). The name refers to how the whale's dappled gray skin resembles that of a drowned sailor, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The scientific name for narwhal is Monodon monoceros, which means "one tooth, one horn" in Latin.
       
          The narwhal's closest living relative is the beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas). Both narwhals and belugas belong to the Odontoceti group, or toothed whales (as opposed to Mysticeti, or baleen whales), and are the only two living species within the Monodontidae family. Both whale species spend their entire lives in the Arctic Ocean, are similar in size and behavior, and on rare occasions have been known to interbreed.

        <h3>
          The Narwhal Tusk
        </h3>

        <p>
          Narwhals' impressive tusk is their signature feature. However, typically only the males have these so-called unicorn horns. Adult male narwhals grow to be about 15 feet (4.6 meters) long and weigh about 3,500 lbs. (1,590 kilograms). The tusk — which is a long, straight tooth — grows up to 9 feet long (3 m) out of the male's mouth, according to the Polar Science Center at the University of Washington.

          Although narwhals are considered toothed whales, their mouths don't contain any functioning teeth. In males, the right canine tooth remains in the skull and never grows out, while the left canine is the one that shoots out through the gums in a counterclockwise, spiral pattern to form the tusk. Rarely, both teeth protrude, giving the narwhal two tusks. Females are much smaller than males, growing to be about 13 feet (4 m) long and weighing about 2,000 lbs. (910 kg). Scientists consider the tusk a male sex characteristic, but about 15% of female narwhals also grow a tusk.

          Experts have long speculated about why narwhals have this bizarre, elongated tooth. Some theories suggest that the tusk is a tool for survival, as the whales could possibly use it to break up ice at the surface, spear fish for dinner or dig for meals in the seafloor. But the vast majority of female narwhals don't have tusks, and females tend to live longer than males. Therefore, experts think the tusk is probably not an advantage for survival but rather a primarily male sex characteristic that serves as a formidable weapon for competing with other males for mates.
