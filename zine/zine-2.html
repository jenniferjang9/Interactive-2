                <p> Social Media allows us instant and easy communication wherever we go. We’re able to connect with one another in real-time and find our communities. This can either exist between a business and a customer or you and your friends.  </p>

                 These social networking platforms are just an easier way of the database’s ability to store your personal information. Facebook, for instance, recently was accused of tracking users information, reading text message, record from microphones on their cell- ular devices, even monitor calls. Many large social media com- panies violate the privacy policy without us even knowing.
